3. Conduct descriptive analysis.
4. Create a pivot table to quickly calculate and visualize the data. 
Options:

	* Calculate the TotalSteps withrespect to Weekday. 
	Try rows = Weekday; Values = TotalSteps(Average).

	* Calculate type of ActiveDistance withrespect to Weekday. 
	Try rows = Weekday; Values = VeryActiveDistance(Average), ModeratelyActiveDistance(Average), LightActiveDistance(Average).

	* Calculate type of ActiveMinutes withrespect to Weekday. 
	Try rows = Weekday; Values = VeryActiveMinutes(Average), FairlyActiveMinutes(Average), LightlyActiveMinutes(Average).

	* Calculate type of ActiveMinutes withrespect to Weekday 7 Only. 
	Try rows = Weekday; Values = VeryActiveMinutes(Average), FairlyActiveMinutes(Average), LightlyActiveMinutes(Average). Filters = 7

	* Calculate type of ActiveMinutes withrespect to Weekday 3 Only. 
	Try rows = Weekday; Values = VeryActiveMinutes(Average), FairlyActiveMinutes(Average), LightlyActiveMinutes(Average); Filters = 3

5. Save the sheet as DailyActivity_Analyze in the drive.
