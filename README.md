## Ask_Phase
============

The Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer asks us to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. He/She then wants us to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in our presentation. 

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

We will produce a report with the following deliverables:

1. A clear summary of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis

## Prepare_Phase
================

Due to lack of inhouse data we explore public data sets and come across public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits.

* FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
